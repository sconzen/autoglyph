Auto Glyph
=========

##Auto Glyph currently does:

Lists off the glyphs you're currently using.
Lists off glyphs you "should" be using, as recommended by Noxxic and Icy-Veins.

use /ag or /autoglyph to bring up the auto glyph window.

Green == Using a recommended glyph, good for you.

Yellow == Using a glyph that isn't recommended, totally up to you.

Red == Empty glyph slot... what's the matter with you?

##Upcoming Features:

Auto swap glyphs. Apply all recommended glyphs with one click.
Fight by fight recommendations. About to fight Siegecrafter? Use glyph set 1. Garrosh? Glyph set 2.
UI cleanup, split major and minor glyphs.
New slash command /ag *bossname* or /ag %t to get current boss or current target glyph recommendations. Might even add recommended glyphs for pvp if target is a player.

Same functionality, but for talents.

##Things to keep in mind:

All recommendations, be they glyphs or talents are based on Noxxic and Icy-veins guides. If you want in depth explanations why these glyphs are recommended, check with them.

##Issues:

Trying to run RemoveGlyphFromSocket(), causing "taint"... lol no idea what that is. Something about leaking global variables? Only thing I could find with people talking about this is from 2011-2012, blaming it on a blizz issue.
